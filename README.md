# Python Statistics Notebook Readme

This notebook was created as part of my studies for my basic statistics class during my masters. I found that documentation & Q/A for solving stats problems was easy to find for R, so I decided to be rebellious and draft my notes with examples in Python instead.

For anyone stumbling here, I hope they are helpful. For any interested, welcome suggestions and edits to the file but ask that any such edits live in this repository (so that I can review and also take advantage of them!). Please do not clone or segment this out to other locations as, even though they are just notes, it took a long time for me to complile.

Best wishes in your studies!
