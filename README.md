# Python Statistics Notebook Readme

This notebook was created as part of my studies for my basic statistics class during my masters. I found that documentation & Q/A for solving stats problems was easy to find for R programming, as is currently the norm, so I decided to be rebellious and draft my notes with examples in Python instead. This got... carried away, and became a much larger project.

For anyone stumbling here, I hope they are helpful. For any interested, welcome suggestions and edits to the file but ask that any such edits live in this repository (so that I can review and also take advantage of them!). Please do not clone or segment this out to other locations as, even though they are just notes, it took a long time for me to complile.

Best wishes in your studies!

**Note:** The ipynb file is fairly large relative to what Github typically expects, so if it doesn't load a preview, I've added an html version. I haven't checked how well the html pull is formatted though, so just bear that in mind. Just download that and open it in your browser (you may have to click "Save As" on the raw and then open it). As one last alternative option, you could view it using a notebook viewer [such as here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Joshkking/Python-Statistics/blob/master/Python_Statistics_Examples.ipynb).
